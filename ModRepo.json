Ping someone who looks active before pinging all, please.\n- Include the mod name, a short description, the version, and the download link.\n- Include a changelog, whether it is ok to add to an existing save, whether the update is save-compatible, a forum link, source code link, and an image.\n- Keep the post reasonably short. Use only highlights from a changelog and pare down the description.\n- Add an image/gif to showcase your mod; it will make people more likely to download it if they can see what they\u0027re getting into.\n- Compress your mod to a `.zip` (recommended because of native support on all systems) and host it somewhere (GitHub, BitBucket, GDrive, Patreon, etc).\n- Tip: write in a text editor instead of Discord to avoid accidental sending/deletion, then copy/paste to Discord.\n- Tip: when adding a new version, edit your old post, copy it, then paste it and modify it to make the new post.\n- Tip: wrapping a link with `\u003c` and `\u003e` will tell Discord not to attach a link preview.\n\nSuggested Starter Template\n```\n__**Onslaught of Onslaughts 1.0.0**__\nAdds 200 Onslaught reskins and over 500 Onslaught-related loading screen tips.\nSafe to add to saves and safe to update on the same save (save-compatible).\n\n\\`\\`\\` (without the 3 \\, only the `)\nAdded\n- 10 more Onslaught reskins\n\nModified\n- Phase-slaughts now use mine system.\n\nFixed\n- Switched on Offslaught.\n\\`\\`\\`\n\ndownload: \u003chttps://example.com/onslaught-of-onslaughts-1.0.0.zip\u003e\nforum: \u003chttps://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic\u003d00000\u003e\nsource code: \u003chttps://github.com/example/ooo\u003e\n```",

Also features basic ship modes (e.g. LowerShields when Flux \u003e 50%) and a ~~badly~~ expertly done GUI.\nCan be added/removed to/from an ongoing campaign.\n\nRelevant new features in 0.11.0: Lots of bugfixes for the custom targeting AI, rework of target/avoidShields modes (now consider shield flanking)\n\nNew features in 0.12.0: GUI polish, ability to load suggested weapon modes. \nNote for faction/content extension mod authors: You can now add suggested modes/suffixes for your weapons in modSettings.json (refer to https://github.com/DesperatePeter/starsector-advanced-weapon-control/blob/devel2/data/config/modSettings.json for an example)\n\nFeedback is much appreciated, especially on the pre-release version.\nThanks and happy gaming/modding!",

Speed increased to 45.\n- Caiman: System changed to Entropy Consolidator. Speed increased to 85.\n- Entropy Consolidator: Acts like a normal damper field, but generates (interceptable) homing energy projectiles based on incoming damage.\nWeapons:\n- Fusion Beams (all sizes): Now requires 0.5 seconds of uninterrupted armor damage to trigger the explosion.\n- Nanoacid Cannons (all sizes): Slightly improved efficiency; increased projectile velocity.\n- Inversion Beam: Improved EMP damage and arc rate.\nHullmods:\n- Coherency Amplifier: Fixed an issue where flak QGPD shots could deal energy damage to the same target multiple times.\n- Geodesic Shield Matrix: Reworked, simplified, and nerfed. Now transfers a flat amount of damage from each hit to armor. Reduced the unfolding rate bonus to 50%.

      "description": "**BigBeans Ship Compilation v0.1.92**\nA growing pack of ships kitbashed and painted by myself or adopted from Spiral Arms.\n\n`BSC:\n\nNew Content:\nCarynx class carrier added.\nSorn class Defensive Destroyer added. (Thanks to Coherrent Watermelon for the base sprite)\n\nSprite Changes:\nHammerhead (LP) sprite updated to match new Hammerhead sprite better.\nTerringzean sprite changes again.\nStern completely resprited. No longer resembles a squashed Hammerhead. (Thanks to Passwalker for some sprite ideas)\nCassina has had its sprite changed a bit, more colour variation.\n\nBalance Changes\nFixed Cassina Weapon arcs.\nTerringzean now has Heavy Ballistic Integration. Slightly increased speed and slightly increased max flux, base dissipation and hull points. Should make it a more capable capital and easier to outfit. 56DP instead of 60DP now too.\nRestitution Torp nerfed a bit, now does 1750 damage and has 210 speed, EMP damage 500 but its EMP effect now arcs.\nShalloch has been nerfed, was too powerful and came with too many free hull mods\nStern has one less small, actually helps manage its small flux pool.\n\nBSC Drone Submod: removed white stripes from drones, making them pure blue to better match other high tech ships. Added Merlon (LC)`\n\nSave Compatible with 0.1.9 and 0.1.8.5b\n\nDownload link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1asq8VveyY9vTMslEK9YllFA_KPnpy0sc/view?usp\u003dsharing\nDownload for Drone Submod: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O0MLCKtSA4BSWjM0Di1kP_FrRBfZHYgw/view?usp\u003dsharing\nForum Link: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic\u003d21358.0",

      "description": "**Fast Engine Rendering v1.1.0**\nUses modern OpenGL rendering techniques to efficiently render custom engine plumes. The main purpose of this mod is a performance boost, taking advantage of modern GPU horsepower. The increase is found through removing CPU load and transferring it to the GPU, which vanilla starsector does not take advantage tremendously.\n\nRequires a GPU that supports OpenGL 3.3\n\n```\nv1.1.0\n-updated shader code to optimised versions from Jon Micheelsen\n-tweaked glow visuals\n-fixed bugs with system activated engines for good hopefully\n-reload engine data with F8\n-fixed bug with force override setting```\n\nFeatures:\n\u003e Replace SHIP (and fighter) engine plumes and glows with a fast instanced renderer. Moderate testing suggests a ~25% increase in performance in large battles with many fighter/ships, your mileage may vary.\n\u003e Crisp 😩 👌 and smooth engine visual\n\nCaveats:\n\u003e Does not affect missile engines, they will still use vanilla behaviour. Engine colour changing has been implemented for Safety Overrides, Plasma Jets and Plasma Burn, however any other modded effects will not take effect because it is hardcoded, this is not fixable unfortunately.\n**Download:** https://github.com/automatopaste/fast-engine-rendering/releases/download/v1.1.0/FastEngineRendering_v1.1.0.zip",

For starter I recommending the Safe pack but if you trust your high end PC to pack a punch do give Dangerous pack a go. As for people who\u0027re curious about what this do read the Documentation.txt included on each pack.\n\nKnown issues\n```\n- Due to how the mod works, the game may show \"Memory Leak! Campaign Duplicates\" over time. This is okay!\n\n- However if one of your mod list does have a memory leak.. this mod may fail to clean extra copies.\n```\n\nFully save compatible! If the game doesn\u0027t launch after you replace the `vmparam` and you\u0027re using JRE8 pack, make sure the `jre` folder is already swapped with JRE8!",

Ed.)**\n\nTo some the GMDA is a Robin Hood-like police organisation, stealing from the established factions and giving it to the low-down independent-leaning folks across the sector. To others, they are an exploitative mafia who reave established factions and hiding behind their false image in independent ports. Regardless of the truth, the GMDA is a persistent and annoying threat to the faction merchant, and one that disappears when stronger foes appear.\n\nChangelog\n0.9.8a\n-Added GM Health Service ships, that boost marines, reduce crew loss across the fleet, and use obscene defense shuttles.\n-Mudskipper (GMHS), Nebula (GMHS) and Starliner (GMHS).\n\n-Added GM Fire Service ships, that help salvage and speed up repairs, and are supported by strange defense fighters.\n-Shepherd (GMFS), Gemini (GMFS) and Mora (GMFS).\n-Also added GMFS weapons -  they\u0027re strange, and niche, and weird, and possibly powerful when used correctly.\n\n-Bluebottler gun is no longer a weak EMP stream weapon, it\u0027s now like a small MG thumper\n\n-Updated to 0.95.1a\n\nSavegame compatible *with previous version*, otherwise not savegame compatible.\n\nDownload here:\nhttps://bitbucket.org/King_Alfonzo/i-will-make-sindria-great-again/downloads/GrytpypeMoriarty_0_9_8a.zip",

Both organisations suffer from an obsession with gene-modding to go above conventional humanity in strength, speed, intelligence - and cruelty.\n\nThe Draco Group, aristocratic and cold, harvest populations to imbibe their blood in their hedonistic rituals, reaving on high-speed high-tech ships from the system of Prester John. The Fang Society, animalistic and vicious, prey on defenseless peoples to consume, eat and torture, roaming the sector from heavily armoured ships.\n\nWhile their hatred for the Sector is well know, their loathing for each other is even greater. It is for this reason that their impact on the Sector at large is relatively minor, as they are more content to butcher each other.\n\n*0.0.3 Changes*\n\n-Fang Society now uses ~~the Luddic Experimental~~ a completely new and novel Damper Field system as a replacement for their shield; their hullmods now give less armour and less hull to compensate.\n-Draco Group now possesses a passive EMP arc system that zaps nearby enemies, with the zapping rate increasing with rising flux. Shields now take more damage, and the range clamp to 600 units is now more severe to compensate.\n-Fang and Draco now have rudimentary Nexerellin starting options\n\n*0.0.3a*\n-Fixed the Fang CTD\n-Fixed the Draco EMP hitting friendly missiles\n\n*Savegame Compatible*\n\n\nDOWNLOAD:\nhttps://bitbucket.org/King_Alfonzo/i-will-make-sindria-great-again/downloads/HMI_Supervillains_0_0_3a.zip",

I wanted to get a crash hotfix regarding a naming mismatch out tonight so the increased threat release has not been fully tested during a complete game. They seemed to be more aggressive and everything should go as planned but yea you know how that goes. Please let me know if you feel I over tuned them.\n\n**Download:** https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qU06YXnPXJTxbPrVG5A1EHWiiqyxk7mP/view?usp\u003dsharing",

That\u0027s fixed now. I also added tooltips, so now you\u0027ll actually know what the version of the available update is - and what the pretty colours actually mean.\n\n- **New:**\n  - Version information tooltips\n    - Tooltips appear when you hover over the icons in the `Version` column\n    - Tooltips detail what type of update is available (`Major`, `Minor`, etc) and the version number of the update\n- **Fixed:**\n  - Selecting \"overwrite\" in the update/overwrite dialogue should now correctly perform an overwrite\n  - There were some other cases where a similar issue was present, but I hadn\u0027t had reports/actually reproduced them myself\n\n**Notable Previous Changes:**\n- **New**\n  - Duplicate mod detection\n    - Presents a new modal window when duplicate mod installs are detected\n    - The modal will include a list of all known duplicate mods. \n    - Each entry will present details about the duplicates, including their version, path, last modification date and creation date\n  - Overwrite requests are now grouped into a single window, preventing new window spam when updating many mods at once\n    - You may need to scroll the window to view all updates/conflicts, but \"Overwrite All\" and \"Cancel All\" are provided for convenience\n- **Fixes**\n  - All modals (logs, overwrite requests, etc) now scroll their contents instead of it going out of view\n  - Updates/overwrites now preserve enable state in the UI (enable state was still set correctly in enabled.json)\n\n||To download, open the `Download` link, then open the assets folder/accordion/thing and pick your platform||\n\n**Download**: \u003chttps://github.com/atlanticaccent/starsector-mod-manager-rust/releases/tag/0.6.2\u003e\n**Sources**: \u003chttps://github.com/atlanticaccent/starsector-mod-manager-rust\u003e\n**Forum**: \u003chttps://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic\u003d21995.0\u003e",

It contains a singular fighter bay and a Targetting Uplink.\n\u003e The Dart is a light Destroyer, focusing on defenses over offensive capabilities.\n\u003e The Corkscrew Destroyer is a missile boat, using vertically aligned missile hardpoints to bring the equivalent of roughly 9 small missile weapons and 1.5 medium missile weapons to bear. Additionally, its Fast Missile Racks allows it to deploy a large amount of ordinance in a short time.\n\u003e The Saint, in contrast to the Corkscrew, is a Destroyer with much less numerous armaments, possessing only two large missile hardpoints, two medium ballistic turret mounts, and four small ballistic turret mounts. However with it\u0027s limited Missile Autoforge system, it is capable of providing support indefinitely for all but the longest of combats.\n\u003e The Armadillo Cruiser, like the Dart, favours durability over offense. While said to be undergunned by most, they serve as a decent distraction, being not quite undergunned enough to ignore.\n\u003e The Collumbus Cruiser is the little brother to the Conquest, possessing much the same armaments, but in lesser number and on a lighter, faster frame.\n\u003e The Ptero Capital Ship is built around a singular concept: Missile saturation. It\u0027s already formidable loadout of four medium missile hardpoints and one large missile hardpoint is further augmented by an unrestricted Missile Autoforge system.\n\u003e The Spear of Persea is designed to pierce enemy battle lines, the Spear is capable of effectively engaging with both broadsides simultaneously.\n\n***Changelog:***\n\u003e Added the Saint-class Destroyer.\n\u003e Reworked the Spear of Persea to make it more Midline.\n\u003e Made the Spear of Persea\u0027s quests more accessible.\n\n*Available at: https://www.patreon.com/posts/mod-links-60097706*",

Totally didn\u0027t just copy the non-Lion Guard or non-XIV variants and tweak it slightly (I totally did, I\u0027m not good at this) Turns out the AI needs these. I definitely totally didn\u0027t not know this.\n\n- Added the Striker XIV, Liberator XIVs, Vindicator XIV, and the Falcon Lion Guard ships to their respective faction spawn pools. Turns out they need those. I made them about 50% more rare than their non-specialized counterparts. The only exception is the Lion Guard Falcon, which is about as common as the Lion Guard Eagle from the base SWP mod. Let me know if any ship seems to be spawning too much or too little.\n\n```\n\n**NOTE**\nThis mod requires Ship/Weapon Pack to work!\n\nAdded download link after posting because am stupid:\n\nhttps://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic\u003d24151.0",

They are now also displayed \"naked\" in refit.\n - All the rare-but-not-unique bounties now have much spicier loadouts.\n - All bounty captains now have better suited skills.\n - Many ship descriptions got a much needed polish pass.\n - Made all the plague-bearer encounters approximatively 267% audio-visually more impressive.```\n\n**Download:** \u003chttps://www.patreon.com/posts/61242196\u003e\n\n**Forum:** \u003chttp://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic\u003d19414.0\u003e\n**Nexus:** \u003chttps://www.nexusmods.com/starsector/mods/50?tab\u003dfiles\u003e\n**MagicLab discord:** \u003chttps://discord.gg/tK3JWBbQ\u003e\n**Bug report/feedback:** \u003chttps://forms.gle/YbQ8cYUA5QaJBCYV8\u003e",

Its population waxes and wanes with each atrocity and each acceptance of refugees from the Core, with only the truly most stubborn fools remaining behind.\n\nDue to their desperate circumstances, and a lack of a proper manufactory, the Federation has been forced to utilise whatever they can lay their hands on to use as ships. Consequently, the Federation uses reconstructed Derelict and Remnant ships, or ships reconstructed from derelicts, as their fleet vessels.\n\n**Forum release, no major change from previous Discord Version**\n\n0.0.2\n-Pre-generated systems will no longer spawn in random sector mode (needs a new game).\n-Fixed systems not spawning in Corvus mode\n-Added the Apogee (BRV) and Odyssey (BRV) - subject to change\n-Tweaked some descriptions\n\n0.0.2a\n-Updated for 0.95.1a\n\nDOWNLOAD\nhttps://bitbucket.org/King_Alfonzo/i-will-make-sindria-great-again/downloads/HMI_brighton_0_0_2a.zip",

Utilising advanced (and possibly A.I. influenced) technology, this colourful faction uses unique energy weapons with high strike power, but faulter after prolonged firing.\n\nVersion 0.0.2e\n\n-Added the Deshr range of ships; brawler phase ships that regenerate weapon charges faster when in phase, and gets a time boost when emerging from phase.\n-Added the Net launcher, a short range Ka weapon that fires HE explosive projectiles.\n-Added the Acacia, a cheap Ba weapon that fires guided HE plasma grenade.\n-Added the Vine Projector, a cheap, short-ranged Ba fragmentation flamethrower for finishing enemies.\n\n-Fiddled with the stats of the Safflower ships to have better flux and worse armour.\n-Khonsur has been reworked a touch to be more combat and less carrier, but still mostly carrier.\n-Small ships have been reworked to be better.\n-Several weapons have seen minor tweaks.\n-Fixed several campaign layer things.\n-Added more to ship descriptions.\n\n-Savegame compatible with previous version. \n-**THIS IS A BETA VERSION.** I\u0027m not sure on the balance of the new Deshr ships tbh.\n\nDownload here:\nhttps://bitbucket.org/King_Alfonzo/i-will-make-sindria-great-again/downloads/holy_covenant_of_kemet_0_0_2e.zip\n\nPlease give me a yell if anything explodes.",

You\u0027ll really have to think about how much increasing the power of a given ship is worth to you.\n\nThis mod applies a reduction to the \"automated ship points\" of any ship outfitted with an AI officer, depenging on the type of core.\nHaving an AI core as an officer also causes a hefty increase to its monthly supply cost, reflecting the huge amount of resources required to run an AI core in the first place.\n\nPlease let me know what you think of the numbers. I\u0027m open to tinkering with them to find out which values feel the best to play with.\n\nv1.2.1 changelog\n```\n- Fixed compatibility issue with Seeker (TAS now only affects ships in the player\u0027s fleet)\n```\n\nv1.2 changelog:\n```\n- Updated values and calculations to adapt to patch 0.95.1a-RC6\n- Added a modifier to AP reduction based on hull size (sorry, running 12 Radiants per fleet would\u0027ve been a bit too much)\n- Added settings file for customisation\n```\n\nForum page: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic\u003d21547.0",

While slow and weakly armoured, it does possess a basic shield, and a Phase Skinner for both defense and mobility.\n\u003e The Sphyrnidae-class Cruiser focuses on close-range brawling. A combination of a Flux Shunt and Unstable Containment Fields lets the Sphyrnidae excel despite the normal weaknesses associated with a shield-focused ship at close quarters.\n\n\u003e The Steve-class frieghter is a more armoured version of the Buffalo, designed for a more hostile sector. A Burn Drive and Damper Field allows it to escape pursuit when needed, while a shielded cargo hold helps avert attacks in the first place.\n\u003e The Tiwaz-class Capital is the little brother to the Onslaught. While it lacks the signature Thermal Pulse Cannons, it possesses a higher level of integration than most ships in existence.\n\u003e The Offensive-class Onslaught, in contrast, is a bigger, beefier Onslaught. Much of its bulk is dedicated to its pair of Thermal Pulse Accelerators, allowing it to fire faster and hit harder. It\u0027s ship system also received adjustments, being replaced with Manuevering Jets to bring its main weapons on-target quicker.\n\n*Available at: https://www.patreon.com/posts/mod-links-60097706*",
